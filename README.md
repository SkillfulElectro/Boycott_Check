# Boycott_Check

Hi everyone,

This is my first time working with an API. I recently acquired access to a website's API specifically designed for users in Iran. It allows them to determine if a website is currently subjected to boycotts or not. You can also use it to check if your Iranian friend has access to certain websites or not!

In the near future, I plan to delve into web automation using C++. My aim is to create tools that can streamline the process of automating your daily tasks on different websites.

I'd like to express my gratitude to www.anti403.ir for generously sharing their database. It has been incredibly helpful!

Thank you.
